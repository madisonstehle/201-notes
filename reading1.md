## How the Web Works

Browsers connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server, this allows you to find the location of the web server.

An Internet Service Provider (ISP) connects you to the web, then the computer contacts a DNS server - which directs you to the correct IP address.

## Markup

HTML5 was released in 2000, and it is not yet completed. However, it can definitely be used as long as your pages are still readable in older browsers that may not have implemented the new system yet.

Previous to HTML5, there was XHTML 1.0 (sometimes written XML) and HTML 4. For this reason, each web page needs to begin with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration.

Every HTML element can carry a `class` and/or `id` global attribute to further identify those elements for reference later on in CSS or JavaScript.
